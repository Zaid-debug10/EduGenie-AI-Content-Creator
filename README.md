A web-based tool to generate educational content, developed as a capstone project for the Internshala Generative AI Course.

## Project Overview
EduGenie is a web application that generates educational content based on a user-provided course title. It produces a course objective, sample syllabus, three measurable learning outcomes (aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy), assessment methods, and recommended readings. This project was developed to showcase skills in Generative AI, web development, and API integration (mock response used in this version).

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Input field for course title and a "Generate Content" button.
- **Content Generation:** Creates structured educational content, including objectives, syllabus, learning outcomes, assessments, and readings.
- **Bloom's Taxonomy Alignment:** Learning outcomes are designed to align with Bloom's Taxonomy levels (Analysis, Synthesis, Evaluation).
- **Error Handling:** Alerts the user if the course title is empty.
- **Copy Functionality:** Includes a "Copy" button to easily copy the generated content.
- **Data Privacy:** User inputs are not stored or logged, ensuring privacy.
- **Loading State:** Displays a "Generating content, please wait..." message during content generation.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API Integration:** Designed to work with OpenAI's API (mock response used in this version)
- **Future Scope:** Can be extended with a Python Flask backend for actual OpenAI API integration
